# Making UAVs autonomous and Internet of Drones
## uavtalk
----------
## Description

They might not be delivering our mail ([or Pizzas][1]) yet, but drones are now intelligent, simple, and reliable enough that they cannot be considered as just toys but formidable business tools.

This talk will briefly go into the inner workings of UAV systems and will demonstrate how python tools can be used to make fully autonomous drones.

The contents of this talk include:

 - Flight Controllers and control theory ([Ardupilot][2])
 - MAVLink ([pymavlink][3], [mavproxy][4])
 - _Real-time_ computer vision ([OpenCV][5], [Tensorflow][6])
 - _DroneKit-Python_

We will go extensively into the abilities of DroneKit-Python and into the future of the Internet of Drones using real-life examples such as pest control ([ScAIRcrow][7]), 
commercial mapping ([Drone Deploy][8]) and delivery ([Flirtey][9]) etc.

The talk will end with a small drone taking a picture of all of us, autonomously ofcourse, demonstrating the discussed topics and the formibale ability of autonomous drones.
